I consistently preferred ruffled chips, as they often provide a different texture and can enhance the overall eating experience. Additionally, I showed a preference for sour cream & onion flavor over bbq, but the presence of ruffles was a more decisive factor in my choices.'>,\n",

I consistently preferred ruffled chips over non-ruffled ones, as the texture they provide is appealing. Additionally, I showed a preference for sour cream & onion flavor over bbq when both options were available with the same ruffle attribute. However, the presence of ruffles was the most decisive factor in my choices.'>]"
