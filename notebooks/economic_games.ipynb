By consistently choosing to cooperate, I aim to establish a pattern of trust and mutual cooperation with my opponent. If both players cooperate, the payoff is higher for both (10, 10) compared to mutual defection (4, 4). While there is a temptation to defect for a higher immediate payoff (12, 1), this could lead to a breakdown in cooperation, resulting in lower overall payoffs in subsequent rounds. Assuming the opponent is rational and also seeks to maximize their long-term payoffs, they might also choose to cooperate if they observe consistent cooperation from me.
