# `lludens`: LLMs that play economics games

Thin wrapper around `llm` library to simulate economic games between LLMs.
The `TotreLLM` class is an economic agent that accepts a system prompt and keeps track of its own history of interactions.

Examples currently include a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma - see `notebooks/basics.ipynb`.
